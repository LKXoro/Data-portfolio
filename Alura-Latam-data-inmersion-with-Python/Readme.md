## Welcome to data inmersion with Python repo

In it will be shown the process realized on the Alura Latam team sesions to make an introduction to data analysis and data science with `python`, by showing several libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `sklearn`. It will show an exploratory analysis, statistics and data visualization, also it will apply a machine learning predictive model. All of this on real state data from Bogot√°, Colombia.

I want to thank the Alura Latam team for this opportunity since it was a great chance to learn and the possibility to add the project to my portfolio.
